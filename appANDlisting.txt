The router knows it needs to handle routes related to listings because of how it is set up and used in the main application file (app.js). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

Step 1: Define Routes in the Router (listing.js)
In listing.js, you create a router and define all the routes related to listings. This router is then exported from the file.

javascript
Copy code
// listing.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Listing = require('../models/listing'); // Import the Listing model

// Route to get all listings
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
    const allListings = await Listing.find();
    res.render("listings/index.ejs", { allListings });
});

// Route to get the form for creating a new listing
router.get("/new", (req, res) => {
    res.render("listings/new.ejs");
});

// Route to create a new listing
router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
    const newListing = new Listing(req.body.listing);
    await newListing.save();
    res.redirect("/listings");
});

// More routes can be defined similarly...

module.exports = router; // Export the router
Step 2: Import and Use the Router in the Main Application (app.js)
In app.js, you import the router from listing.js and tell your Express app to use this router for all requests that start with /listings.

javascript
Copy code
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const path = require('path');
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Listing = require('./models/listing'); // Import the Listing model
const listings = require('./routes/listing'); // Import the listings router

// Middleware
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));

// Set up view engine and views folder
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));

// Database connection
mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wanderlust', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
.then(() => console.log("Database connected"))
.catch(err => console.log("Database connection error:", err));

// Use the listings router for all routes starting with /listings
app.use('/listings', listings);

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Serving on port 3000');
});
How It Works
Router Definition:

In listing.js, you define various routes using router.get, router.post, etc.
These routes handle specific URL paths (e.g., /new, /, /edit).
Router Export:

The router is exported from listing.js using module.exports = router;.
Router Import:

In app.js, you import this router using const listings = require('./routes/listing');.
Mounting the Router:

You mount the router in app.js using app.use('/listings', listings);.
This line tells Express: "For any request that starts with /listings, use the routes defined in the listings router."
Example Requests
Request to /listings:
Express sees /listings and looks for a router that handles this path.
It finds the listings router and uses the route defined as router.get("/") in listing.js.
Request to /listings/new:
Express sees /listings/new and looks for a router that handles this path.
It finds the listings router and uses the route defined as router.get("/new") in listing.js.
By importing and using the listings router in app.js, you instruct your application to delegate all requests that start with /listings to the routes defined in listing.js. This keeps your main application file clean and your routing logic organized.
